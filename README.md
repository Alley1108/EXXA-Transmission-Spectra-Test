# EXXA-Transmission-Spectra-Test
This project focuses on developing a DenseNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂) concentrations from synthetic spectral data. The dataset, consisting of around 1000 samples with multiple parameters, was preprocessed and analyzed to train a deep learning model capable of learning complex spectral patterns.

The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, with dropout regularization applied to minimize overfitting and improve model generalization. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, ensuring high precision in predictions. Extensive evaluation was performed through metric analysis and visualization of training loss curves to optimize performance.

This project highlights the integration of data preprocessing, model design, training, and performance evaluation in a cohesive pipeline. The implementation was carried out on Google Colab using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.

By combining deep learning and spectral data analysis, this project demonstrates how CNN architectures can be effectively adapted for scientific data modeling and regression-based prediction tasks, contributing to real-world applications in spectroscopy and environmental analysis.
